# Book/Chapter draft: Dimensionality reduction - exercises

Collected exercises on dimensionality reduction from various sources

Sources:
- CMU
- Stanford
- MIT
- David Sontag
- Radfod Neal
- an important source of exercises is LA4ML = a course from http://www4.ncsu.edu/~slrace/index.html; the link is no longer available; it was a course called "AA502, 2017, Linear Algebra", taught by Shaina Race, PhD, North Carolina State University
...

Directories/Files:
    "important_photos" = some proofs/ideas written by hand; there are mentioned in the pdf files where needed

    "practical exercises" = practical exercises

    "exercises" = the solved and proposed exercises 

    "dimensionality-reduction-roadmap.pdf" = some theory regarding linear algebra or dim. reduction

Observations:
- there are typos
- the solutions were not modified; they are the original solutions from authors of the problem
- sometimes, there are some indications written in bold, or as Observations etc.
- there are some indications in red
- there are some problems by Alina Munteanu; they are marked by "BY ALINA MUNTEANU"
- in general, the order of exercises is good
- when I had some important observations, I wrote them near the exercise
